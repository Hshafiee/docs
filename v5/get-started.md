Title: Getting Started
Description: Getting started with TypeRocket v5 Andromeda 

---

## Starting A New Project

To get started, install **TypeRocket v5 Andromeda** for free as a [plugin](/docs/v5/install-via-plugin) or using [composer](/docs/v5/install-via-composer).

## Upgrading from v1 Pro to v5 Pro

If you are upgrading from Pro v1 you can [read more here](/docs/v5/upgrade-guide-v1-to-v5/). When upgrading you will need to [access your account](/account/) and upgrade your license once you have completed the upgrade process.

**Only once you have a working upgrade for all of your sites** go to "Account -> View Licenses -> View Upgrades" and upgrade to a TypeRocket Pro v5 â€“ Andromeda **license of the correct size** from there for free.

After and before upgrading, you will have access to both `v1` and `v5`. However, your license will only give you automatic updates for your current license type.
